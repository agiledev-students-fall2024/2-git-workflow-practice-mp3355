[How AI is Changing Software Development](https://flatironschool.com/blog/software-engineering-in-the-age-of-ai/)

The article highlights how AI is transforming industries, roles, and tasks, with tools like ChatGPT enhancing productivity. Despite uncertainties about AIâ€™s future, software engineering remains a viable and essential career, with demand expected to grow due to digital transformation and AI integration. Key skills like coding (Python, JavaScript), problem-solving, and creativity are still foundational, while understanding AI and machine learning is increasingly important. New AI-related roles are emerging, and ethical considerations will be crucial as AI becomes more embedded in development processes. Continuous learning and coding are emphasized as critical skills for the future.

## An Interesting Question from Daniel Khaitov
Which workers are in more danger: writers and musicians or computer scientists and mathematicians? AI can write books, make music, write code, and solve math olympiads, but perhaps workers in creative spaces are more protected because of the inherently "human" nature of their work.
